            <h2> Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>Tennis is comprised of many different techniques, but in general you need mastery in the main three.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Groundstrokes</li>
                <li>Serves</li>
                <li>Volleys</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Groundstrokes</h2>
            <p>The groundstroke is a forehand or backhand stroke that the player uses to hit the ball from the baseline after the ball has hit the ground once on the player's side. The shot is 
                versatile in that it can be hit in all parts of the court. Aggresive players such as Rafael Nadal utilizes this technique in order to push his oppenents to designated sides of the court
                using monstourous amounts of power and topspin. Below are some videos produced by Tennis Warehouse to get you started with the basics.
            </p>
            <p>Note: One-Handed backhands are more difficult to master</p>

            <h2>Serves</h2>
            <p>The serve is the first move that all tennis players make to start a game. The player serving starts by tossing the ball in the air and generating massive amounts of power 
                from legs and into the ball. On paper, this move does not seem that complex, however, differences in technique can vary the serving speeds from 50 mph to the world record of
                157.2 mph from the legendary server John Isner. Below is a video produced by On Court With USPTA and former pro Rick Macci on the Mechanics Of The Serve.

            <h2>Volleys</h2>
            <p>Most players put a lot of time mastering the first two fundamentals and forget about volleys. Volleys are the strokes used to push the ball back over the net with finesse. without
                putting excess force in the racquet, the volley uses the original force of the ball to project it to the desired portion of the oppnents courts. This technique is heavily used in 
                doubles format. One of the major advantages of volleys are to disrupt the pace of the point and take charge. You can see the mechcanics demonstrated in teh video below from Essential Tennis.
