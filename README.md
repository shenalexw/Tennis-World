## Abstract
CS290 Web Development - Portfolio Project

In this project, you need to use HTML/CSS and JavaScript to build a simple website and publish it online. You can build a personal website for yourself, or a website of a small business or organization like a farm, a restaurant, a park, a hotel, a baseball club, or a website of some tutorials, showing skills that you have expertise in and want to share with others. You have a lot of freedom to determine the details of your website as long as you meet the requirements.  The theme doesnâ€™t need to be real. Be creative! 

Requirements:

- The webpages should be presentable as a whole; the interface should be user friendly (text should be easy to read).
- The website should contain pictures and/or videos, and they should be presentable as well (placed in a proper place, easy to see, have proper size and resolution).
- Website has 1 homepage and at least 3 subpages; the homepage and subpages have a horizontal menu that leads to the other pages. This means 4 total pages will be required.
- The homepage has picture carousel animation (slideshow effect, for example, pictures in this page http://oregonstateparks.org/ (Links to an external site.)). This needs to autoscroll and have forward and back buttons.
- Have a scroll box in one page. You can put text only or text with pictures inside the scroll box.  The scroll box should have something like a scroll bar to allow users rolling it up and down. Some students have scroll boxes show up after submitting the form, if this is the case make sure you add a comment to the grading TA letting them know.
- One page has a form either submit via get or post (enter the email and subscribe, a short survey, etc.)  You can set it to be submitted to http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangluy/tools/class-content/form_tests/check_request.php (Links to an external site.) or your own link as long as it is working. Forms that do not actually transmit the data somewhere will not receive full marks.
- One page has unordered HTML list with several entries. The horizontal menu does not count for this requirement.
- There is one button to download files (map to the farm, menu in the restaurant, a personal CV, etc.) The downloaded file can either open in the browser or download to the local computer.
- There is a link that you can click and leads to outside webpages (LinkedIn, Yelp, email, etc.)
- You are allowed to add other features not listed above to your website as long as they are functional and serve some purpose in your website.
- You should use at least HTML/CSS and JavaScript in your project.
